# service file for autostarting your docker builds on system reboot
# I wrote this file so that in case of server crashes anyone can simply reboot the system and get the system running again
# I paired this up with aws system checks, In case of failed system check I applied the restart policy. So your system never goes
# out for more than 2 minutes even in case of seve crashes. 

# /etc/systemd/system/docker-compose-app.service
